### ⿥ Urgent or Threatening Language

*Examples from Email:*
- “We detected suspicious activity…”

*Purpose:*  
These lines create *urgency and fear*, pressuring the recipient into clicking the malicious link without thinking.

### ⿦ Mismatched URLs (Hover-to-Reveal)

*Visible URL:*  
https://apple-id-confirmation.com/secure

*Expected Legitimate Domain:*  
https://appleid.apple.com

Hovering over the link (in a real email client) would reveal that it *doesn’t redirect to the official Apple website*. This is a key phishing tactic.

*Notable Issues:*
- Slightly odd sentence: “Thank you for being part of Apple.”
- Missing proper punctuation and formatting
- Generic tone and incorrect email signature

*Analysis:*  
While not full of blatant spelling mistakes, the *grammar and sentence structure are off*, which is common in phishing emails.
